# Orchestrates which monitors are enabled so Sunshine's Wayland capture has

# is the sole enabled one.
#
# ORDERING IS SAFETY-CRITICAL, do not "simplify" into fewer/batched calls:
#   connect:    enable dummy FIRST, then disable real monitors one at a time
#   disconnect: enable real monitors one at a time FIRST, then disable dummy
# At every step, at least one monitor must remain enabled. Going through a
# moment with zero enabled monitors is exactly what triggered the DRM stall
# above during testing. A settle delay between EVERY hyprctl eval call is
# also required — the stall was also observed when calls were fired without
# one, even when never reaching zero enabled monitors.
#
# Real monitors normally use Hyprland's "auto" position (see
# omanix.monitors.position) — but "auto" re-flows EVERY auto-positioned
# monitor whenever any monitor's enabled state changes, so enabling/disabling
# the dummy plug would otherwise silently shift your real monitors to new
# positions. This is why OMANIX_DUMMY_DISPLAY_REAL_MONITORS carries each real
# monitor's exact mode/position/scale: every hyprctl eval call below sets them
# explicitly, so "auto" is never in play for any monitor this script touches.
#
# apply_waybar_variant below is called with the dummy connector's OWN scale
# on connect (that's what's actually rendered on the streamed monitor,
# unlike scaledDesktop where a single real monitor is both scaled and
# rendered), and with the real monitors' scale on disconnect. Deliberately
# called AFTER the monitor topology has fully settled (real monitors already
# disabled on connect / already re-enabled on disconnect), with the "restart"
# variant, not refresh_waybar's SIGUSR2 — restarting waybar while monitors
# are still mid-transition would just recreate the same stale-bar-window
# problem restart_waybar exists to fix.
